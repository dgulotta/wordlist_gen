# wordlist\_gen

Utilities for generating wordlists for puzzling.  Currently there is only
a program for generating lists of movies, TV shows, and actors from IMDb
data.  See [rspeer/solvertools](https://github.com/rspeer/solvertools) and
[dgulotta/puzzle-tools](https://github.com/dgulotta/puzzle-tools) for more
wordlist generators.

To run the program:
